/**
 * This mixin provides management of a set of features that can be manipulated via the `features` config.
 *
 * The first step in using `Featureable` is to define the family of features using `Factoryable` to declare a base
 * class for features to extend:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class SuperWidgetFeature extends InstancePlugin.mixin(Factoryable) {
 *      static get factoryable() {
 *          //
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * The various feature classes extend the `SuperWidgetFeature` base class and call `initClass()` to register themselves:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  export default class AmazingSuperWidgetFeature extends SuperWidgetFeature {
 *      static get type() {
 *          return 'amazing';
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 *  AmazingSuperWidgetFeature.initClass();
 * ```
 *
 * A class that supports these features via `Featureable` is declared like so:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class SuperWidget extends Widget.mixin(Featureable) {
 *      static get featureable() {
 *          return {
 *              factory : SuperWidgetFeature
 *          };
 *      }
 *
 *      static get configurable() {
 *          return {
 *              // Declare the default features. These can be disabled by setting them to a falsy value. Using
 *              // configurable(), the value defined by this class is merged with values defined by derived classes
 *              // and ultimately the instance.
 *              features : {
 *                  amazing : {
 *                      ...
 *                  }
 *              }
 *          };
 *      }
 *  }
 *```

/**
 * A description of how to protect a method from reentry.
 *
 * A value of `true` is transformed using the key as the `all` value. For example, this:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class Foo extends Base.mixin(Fencible) {
 *      static fenced = {
 *          foo : true
 *      };
 * ```
 *
 * Is equivalent to this:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class Foo extends Base.mixin(Fencible) {
 *      static fenced = {
 *          foo : {
 *              all : ['foo']
 *          }
 *      };
 * ```
 *
 * Strings are split on spaces to produce the `all` array. For example, this:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class Foo extends Base.mixin(Fencible) {
 *      static fenced = {
 *          foo : 'foo bar'
 *      };
 * ```
 *
 * Is equivalent to this:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class Foo extends Base.mixin(Fencible) {
 *      static fenced = {
 *          foo : {
 *              all : ['foo', 'bar']
 *          }
 *      };
 * ```
 *
 * This indicates that `foo()` cannot be reentered if `foo()` or `bar()` are already executing. On entry to `foo()`,
 * both `foo()` and `bar()` will be fenced (prevented from entering).
 *
 * @typedef {Object} MethodFence
 * @property {String|String[]} [all] One or more keys that must all be currently unlocked to allow entry to the fenced
 * method. String values are converted to an array by splitting on spaces.
 * @property {String|String[]} [any] One or more keys of which at least one must be currently unlocked to allow entry
 * to the fenced method. String values are converted to an array by splitting on spaces.
 * @property {String|String[]} [lock] One or more keys that will be locked on entry to the fenced method and released
 * on exit. String values are converted to an array by splitting on spaces. By default, this array includes all keys
 * in `all` and `any`.

/**
 * This mixin provides management of a named set of {@link #typedef-ResponsiveState} objects that are conditionally
 * applied in response to the widget's size or other platform details. The names of the {@link #typedef-ResponsiveState}
 * objects are the keys of the {@link #config-responsive} config object. For example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class ResponsiveButton extends Button.mixin(Responsive) {
 *      static configurable = {
 *          responsive : {
 *              small : {
 *                  // this is a ResponsiveState object named "small"
 *                  text : 'S'
 *              },
 *              medium : {
 *                  text : 'M'
 *              }
 *              large : {
 *                  text : 'L'
 *              }
 *          }
 *      };
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * When the conditions are right for the button to be in the `'small'` responsive state, the `text` config will be set
 * to `'S'`.
 *
 * Any desired configs can be present in a {@link #typedef-ResponsiveState} object, however, the `when` and `callback`
 * properties have special meaning to this mixin and are reserved.
 *
 * ## Selecting the Responsive State
 *
 * To determine the current responsive state, the `when` property is consulted for each candidate state.
 *
 * If `when` is a number, it is understood to be a width threshold and, if the widget's `width` is equal or less than
 * that value, the score is that value. For example, a value of 400 would produce a score of 400 if the widget's width
 * were less than or equal to 400. If the widget's width is greater than 400, the state would be skipped.
 *
 * If `when` is a function, it is called with two parameters: a readonly reference to the widget and the
 * {@link Core.helper.BrowserHelper} singleton object. The function should return the numeric score if the state is
 * applicable, or `null` or `false` if the state should be skipped.
 *
 * The state that has the minimum score is selected as the responsive state for the widget.
 *
 * Consider the default responsive states and their `when` values:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  responsive : {
 *      small : {
 *          when : 400
 *      },
 *
 *      medium : {
 *          when : 800
 *      },
 *
 *      large : {
 *          when : () => Infinity
 *      },
 *
 *      '*' : {}
 *  },
 * ```
 *
 * For example, if the width of the widget is 300: the score for the `small` responsive state is 400, the score for
 * the `medium` responsive state is 800, and the score for `large` is infinity. In effect, the `large` state is always
 * a candidate, but will also always lose to other candidate states. In this case, the `small` state has the minimum
 * score and is selected as the responsive state.
 *
 * If the width of the widget is 600: the `small` state would be skipped, while the `medium` and `large` states would
 * produce the same scores resulting in `medium` being the responsive state.
 *
 * The `when` functions have access to any properties of the widget instance in the first argument, but are also passed
 * the {@link Core.helper.BrowserHelper} singleton as a second argument. This can be used as shown in the following,
 * over-simplified example:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  class ResponsiveWidget extends Widget.mixin(Responsive) {
 *      static configurable = {
 *          responsive : {
 *              small : {
 *                  when : ({ width }, { isMobileSafari }) => isMobileSafari && width <= 600 && 10
 *                  text : 'iPhone'
 *              },
 *              medium : {
 *                  when : ({ width }, { isMobileSafari }) => isMobileSafari && width <= 1024 && 20
 *                  text : 'iPad'
 *              }
 *              large : {
 *                  text : 'Desktop'
 *              }
 *          }
 *      };
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * It is best to avoid mixing `when` threshold values and `when` functions as the resulting scores can be confusing.
 * @mixin

var Responsive = (Target => class Responsive extends (Target || Base).mixin(Delayable, Fencible) {
  static $name = 'Responsive';
  static configurable = {
    /**
     * Specifies the various responsive state objects keyed by their name. Each key (except `'*'`, see below) in
     * this object is a state name (see {@link #config-responsiveState}) and its corresponding value is the
     * associated {@link #typedef-ResponsiveState} object.
     *
     * Some properties of a `ResponsiveState` object are special, for example `when` and `callback`. All other
     * properties of the state object are config properties to apply when that state is active.
     *
     * The `when` property can be a function that computes the score for the state. The state whose `when` function
     * returns the lowest score is selected and its non-special properties will be assigned to the instance. If
     * `when` is a number, it will be converted into a scoring function (see below).
     *
     * A `when` function accepts two readonly parameters and returns either a numeric score if the state should be
     * considered, or `false` or `null` if the state should be ignored (i.e., it does match with the current state).
     *
     * The first parameter is a readonly proxy for the {@link #config-responsiveTarget widget} whose size and other
     * properties determine the state's score. The proxy tracks property access to that widget in order to update
     * the responsive state should any of those properties change.
     *
     * The second argument to a `when` function is the {@link Core.helper.BrowserHelper} singleton. This allows
     * a `when` function to conveniently test platform and browser information.
     *
     * The state whose `when` function returns the lowest score is selected as the new
     * {@link #config-responsiveState} and its config object (minus the `when` function and other special
     * properties) is applied to the instance.
     *
     * If `when` is a number, it is converted to function. The following two snippets produce the same `when`
     * scoring:
     *
     * ```javascript
     *      small : {
     *          when : 400,
     *          ...
     *      }
     * ```
     *
     * The above converted to:
     *
     * ```javascript
     *      small : {
     *          when : ({ width }) => width <= 400 && 400,
     *          ...
     *      }
     * ```
     * Selecting the lowest score as the winner allows for the simple conversion of width threshold to score value,
     * such that the state with the smallest matching width is selected.
     *
     * If the `responsive` config object has an asterisk key (`'*'`), its value is used as the default set of config
     * properties to apply all other states. This will be the only config properties to apply if no `when` function
     * returns a score. In this way, this special state object acts as a default state as well as a set of
     * default values for other states to share. This state object has no `when` function.
     *
     * The default for this config is:
     * ```javascript
     *  {
     *      small : {
     *          when : 400
     *      },
     *
     *      medium : {
     *          when : 800
     *      },
     *
     *      large : {
     *          when : () => Infinity
     *      },
     *
     *      '*' : {}
     *  }
     * ```
     *
     * A derived class (or instance) can use these states by populating other config properties, define
     * additional states, and/or adjust the `when` properties to use different size thresholds.
