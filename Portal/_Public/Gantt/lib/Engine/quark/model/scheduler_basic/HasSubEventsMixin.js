/**
 * This mixin provides the notion of "sub events" for the [[BaseEventMixin]], which is a bit more general concept
 * of the "child" events. This special notion is required, because the event store can be a flat store, not providing
 * any tree structuring. In the same time, we treat the project instance as a "parent" event for all events in the flat
 * event store - so it accumulates the same aggregation information as other "regular" parent events.
 *
 * The event with this mixin is scheduled according to the "sub events" information - it starts at the earliest date
 * among all sub events and ends at the latest. If there's no "sub events" - it delegates to previous behaviour.
 *
 * Scheduling by children can be disabled by setting [[manuallyScheduled]] flag to `true` which will
 * result [[startDate]] and [[endDate]] fields will keep their provided values.
