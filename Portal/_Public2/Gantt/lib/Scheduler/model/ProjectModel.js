/**
 * This class represents a global project of your Scheduler - a central place for all data.
 *
 * It holds and links the stores usually used by Scheduler:
 *
 * - {@link Scheduler.data.AssignmentStore}
 * - {@link Scheduler.data.DependencyStore}
 * - {@link Scheduler.data.EventStore}
 * - {@link Scheduler.data.ResourceStore}
 *
 * The project uses a calculation engine to normalize dates and durations. It is also responsible for
 * handling references between models, for example to link an event via an assignment to a resource. These operations
 * are asynchronous, a fact that is hidden when working in the Scheduler UI but which you must know about when performing
 * more advanced operations on the data level.
 *
 * When there is a change to data that requires something else to be recalculated, the project schedules a calculation (a
 * commit) which happens moments later. It is also possible to trigger these calculations directly. This snippet illustrate
 * the process:
 *
 1. Something changes which requires the project to recalculate, for example adding a new task:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const [event] = project.eventStore.add({ startDate, endDate });
 * ```
 *
 * 2. A recalculation is scheduled, thus:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * event.duration; // <- Not yet calculated
 * ```
 *
 * 3. Calculate now instead of waiting for the scheduled calculation
 *
 * ```javascript
 * await project.commitAsync();
 *
 * event.duration; // <- Now available
 * ```
 *
 * ## Built in StateTrackingManager
 *
 * The project also has a built in {@link Core.data.stm.StateTrackingManager StateTrackingManager} (STM for short), that
 * handles undo/redo for the project stores (additional stores can also be added). You can enable it to track all
 * project store changes:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // Turn on auto recording when you create your Scheduler:
 * const scheduler = new Scheduler({
 *    project : {
 *        stm : {
 *            autoRecord : true
 *        }
 *    }
 * });
 *
 * // Undo a transaction
 * project.stm.undo();
 *
 * // Redo
 * project.stm.redo();
 * ```
 *
 * Check out the `undoredo` demo to see it in action.

    /**
     * Silences propagations caused by the project loading.
     *
     * Applying the loaded data to the project occurs in two basic stages:
     *
     * 1. Data gets into the engine graph which triggers changes propagation
     * 2. The changes caused by the propagation get written to related stores
     *
     * Setting this flag to `true` makes the component perform step 2 silently without triggering events causing reactions on those changes
     * (like sending changes back to the server if `autoSync` is enabled) and keeping stores in unmodified state.
     *
     * This is safe if the loaded data is consistent so propagation doesn't really do any adjustments.
     * By default the system treats the data as consistent so this option is `true`.
     *
     * ```js
     * new Scheduler({
     *     project : {
     *         // We want scheduling engine to recalculate the data properly
     *         // so then we could save it back to the server
     *         silenceInitialCommit : false
     *     }
     *     ...
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * @config {Boolean} silenceInitialCommit
